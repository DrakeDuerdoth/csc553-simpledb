Lab 1

I don’t have too much to talk about in terms of designs. There were quite a few basic methods where you just were returning an object. The only test that does not work is the last tuple one, which is expected. 
The first lab was an awesome start for the lab. I had some difficulty with figuring out {srcbuild} being empty but got some help from a classmate. I also had some issues with figuring out the correct java build but figured that one out pretty quickly. 
I say I spend about 7 hours on the lab. The hardest part was getting everything setup. Once everything was up and running, it was smooth sailing. can’t wait for this lab to get more complex!
